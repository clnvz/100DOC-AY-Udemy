Hello!

Just a few notes for this repository:
	#1 Project ideas came from a Udemy course (100 Days of Python by Angela Yu)
		- I made the code and only refer to instructor Angela's solution strictly after I accomplished the goal or finished the program.
		- I only see the instructor's solution to improve my coding skills (line reduction, proper format)
		- I can redo and explain everything in here.
	#2 OOP starts on Day 16 onwards
