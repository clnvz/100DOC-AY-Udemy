Hello! This is where I compile all the programs I made while self-learning Python!

Just a few notes for this repository:

#1 Project ideas came from a Udemy course (100 Days of Python by Angela Yu)
	- I always code by my own first and only refer to Inst. Angela's solution strictly AFTER finishing the program/task.
	- I only look at Inst. Angela's solution to improve my coding skills (line reduction, proper structure, systematic process)
	- I can remake and explain everything in here.

#2 OOP starts on Day 16 onwards
